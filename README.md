# Welcome to My Data Science Projects Repository!
Here, I've documented the various projects I've undertaken to explore the intersection of environmental engineering and data science. Each project demonstrates my ongoing journey in leveraging data to address environmental challenges effectively.

Please note that for detailed data and information regarding these projects, you can access them in my other repositories.


**Project 1: [Exploring the relationship between forest cover and CO2 emissions in South America](https://github.com/Mateoferrnandez/Emissions-and-land-)**
In this project, I explored the relationship between forest cover and CO2 emissions in South America. Using pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed data to investigate how forest cover and land use impact CO2 emissions across various countries in the region. Additionally, I created a Power BI dashboard to visualize this relationship more clearly, providing insights into the environmental dynamics of South America.

**Project 2: [Electrical Grid Data Analysis and Forecasting](https://github.com/Mateoferrnandez/GeneracionElectricaColombia)**
This project focuses on data analysis and forecasting of the electrical grid of Colombia's National Interconnected System (SIN).
