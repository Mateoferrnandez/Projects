# Welcome to My Data Analysis/Science Projects Repository!
Here, I've documented the various projects I've undertaken to explore the intersection of environmental engineering and data science. Each project demonstrates my ongoing journey in leveraging data to address environmental challenges effectively.

Please note that for detailed data and information regarding these projects, you can access them in my other repositories.

## Personal Projects

**Project 1: [Exploring the Relationship Between Forest Cover and CO2 Emissions in South America](https://github.com/Mateoferrnandez/Projects/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Exploring%20the%20Relationship%20Between%20Forest%20Cover%20and%20CO2%20Emissions%20in%20South%20America)**  
In this project, I explored the relationship between forest cover and CO2 emissions in South America. Using pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed data to investigate how forest cover and land use impact CO2 emissions across various countries in the region. Additionally, I created a Power BI dashboard to visualize this relationship more clearly, providing insights into the environmental dynamics of South America.  
**Technologies Used**: Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Power BI  


**Project 2: [Webscraping and Analysis of CO2 Emissions Data](https://github.com/Mateoferrnandez/Projects/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Webscraping%20and%20Analysis%20of%20CO2%20Emissions%20Data)**  
A small webscraping project where I created and used a SQL Database to analyze and visualize the Worldmeter data of CO2 emissions by country. This project was also conducted using Jupyter Notebook.
**Technologies Used**: Python, BeautifulSoup, SQL, Jupyter Notebook  


**Project 3: [Electrical Grid Data Analysis and Forecasting](https://github.com/Mateoferrnandez/Projects/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Electrical%20Grid%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Forecasting)**  
This project focuses on data analysis of the electrical grid of Colombia's National Interconnected System (SIN). I applied skills developed in the two previous projects, including the use of Jupyter Notebook and webscraping techniques. Additionally, I created a Power BI dashboard to visualize the dinamics of the electrical grid more clearly
**Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Webscraping, Power bi 

**Project 4: [ Data Cleaning and Transformation of Job Listings and FIFA 21 Datasets](https://github.com/Mateoferrnandez/Projects/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Electrical%20Grid%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Forecasting)**  
In this project, I performed extensive data cleaning and transformation on two datasets: one related to data science job listings from Glassdoor and another containing FIFA 21 player statistics. The main objective was to prepare both datasets for analysis. Key tasks included handling missing values, standardizing and normalizing text data, extracting information from text fields using the NLTK library, and transforming numerical data such as salary estimates and player attributes into structured formats suitable for analysis.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NLTK, Jupyter Notebook



## FreeCodeCamp Projects
Projects that I completed for my Data Analysis with Python Certification, being my first real projects in this area.
