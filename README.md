# Welcome to My Data Analysis/Science Projects Repository!
Here, I've documented the various projects I've undertaken to explore the intersection of environmental engineering and data science. Each project demonstrates my ongoing journey in leveraging data to address environmental challenges effectively.

Please note that for detailed data and information regarding these projects, you can access them in my other repositories.
## Personal Projects

**Project 1: [Exploring the relationship between forest cover and CO2 emissions in South America](https://github.com/Mateoferrnandez/Emissions-and-land-)**
In this project, I explored the relationship between forest cover and CO2 emissions in South America. Using pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed data to investigate how forest cover and land use impact CO2 emissions across various countries in the region. Additionally, I created a Power BI dashboard to visualize this relationship more clearly, providing insights into the environmental dynamics of South America.

**Project 2: [Webscraping and Analysis of CO2 Emissions Data ](https://github.com/Mateoferrnandez/Webscraping-and-Analysis-of-CO2-Emissions-Data/tree/main)**
A small webscraping project where i create and use a SQL Database to analyze and visualize the Worldmeter data of CO2 emissions by country.

**Project 3: [Electrical Grid Data Analysis and Forecasting](https://github.com/Mateoferrnandez/GeneracionElectricaColombia)**
This project focuses on data analysis of the electrical grid of Colombia's National Interconnected System (SIN), in this project i applied skill that i developed in the two previous projects.

## Freecodecamp Projects
Projects that i made for my Data Analysis With Python Certification, being my first real projects in this area
