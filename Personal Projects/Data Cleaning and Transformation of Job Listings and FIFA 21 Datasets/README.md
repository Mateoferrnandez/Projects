# Data Cleaning and Transformation of Job Listings and FIFA 21 Datasets

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on extensive data cleaning and transformation of two datasets: one from Glassdoor related to data science job listings, and another containing FIFA 21 player statistics. The main objective was to prepare both datasets for analysis by addressing missing data, standardizing text fields, extracting information using the NLTK library, and converting numerical data (such as salary estimates and player attributes) into structured formats ready for analytical processing.

### Key Objectives:

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Refine the datasets by handling missing values, normalizing text data, and structuring numerical fields for further analysis.

- **Text Data Processing:** Use tools like NLTK to extract and process relevant information from unstructured text fields.

- **Numerical Data Transformation:** Standardize salary estimates and player attributes for consistency across the datasets.

### Technologies Utilized:

- **Python:** Core language for data manipulation and analysis.
  
- **Pandas:** Key library for efficient data manipulation, enabling data exploration and preparation for modeling.
